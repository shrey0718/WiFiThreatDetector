# WiFiThreatDetector

## 📌 Project Overview  
WiFi networks are often vulnerable to various security threats, such as **open/WEP encryption weaknesses**, **Evil Twin attacks**, and **low signal spoofing**. The **WiFi Threat Detector** is designed to **identify** and **analyze WiFi security risks**, providing an **interactive dashboard, historical logs, and penetration test scoring**.

## 🔥 Problem Statement  
Wireless networks **lack proper security monitoring tools**. Users unknowingly connect to **insecure networks**, exposing their data to cyber threats.  
Common vulnerabilities include:  
✔ Open or WEP-protected networks (**easily hacked**)  
✔ Evil Twin attacks (**rogue access points that mimic legitimate SSIDs**)  
✔ Weak signal spoofing (**used for man-in-the-middle attacks**)  
✔ Lack of **real-time scanning & historical logging** for security analysis  

**This project solves these challenges by continuously scanning WiFi networks and providing structured insights!**

## ✅ Solution Features  
✔ **Automated WiFi scanning** every **120 seconds**  
✔ **Threat detection & penetration test scoring**  
✔ **Historical logging** to track scan results over time  
✔ **Interactive dashboard** with filtering & sorting  
✔ **Detailed network analysis** via pop-ups & historical trends  
✔ **CSV export** for further review
